# Make me a plan which helps me practice to use different data structures in python, the plan does not have to include leetcode style problems, it should be more practical examples and problems which are smaller set and do not take a lot of time solve each one

Here’s a practical, beginner-friendly plan to help you practice different data structures in Python, focusing on short, real-life inspired tasks rather than lengthy or abstract problems. Each exercise should take only a few minutes and is designed to help you understand how and when to use lists, sets, dictionaries, tuples, and queues.

---

## **Week-by-Week Data Structure Practice Plan**

### **Week 1: Lists**

- Create a shopping list and add/remove items.
- Merge two lists by alternating elements from each.
- Slice a list into three equal parts and reverse each chunk[^1].
- Remove duplicates from a list to get only unique items[^2].
- Find the index of a specific item in a list[^2].


### **Week 2: Sets**

- Combine two lists into a set of pairs (e.g., student names and their scores)[^1].
- Find common elements (intersection) between two sets and remove them from one set[^1].
- Check if one set is a subset or superset of another, then clear the set if true[^1].
- Find the difference between two sets (elements in one but not the other)[^2].
- Test if two sets have any elements in common[^2].


### **Week 3: Dictionaries**

- Count the occurrences of each word in a short paragraph and store the counts in a dictionary[^1].
- Create a dictionary from two lists: one with keys (e.g., product names) and one with values (e.g., prices)[^2].
- Find common keys between two dictionaries[^2].
- Update a dictionary with new key-value pairs and remove a key.


### **Week 4: Tuples \& Advanced List Techniques**

- Store immutable pairs of coordinates as tuples and check if a specific coordinate exists[^2].
- Convert a tuple to a list and vice versa[^2].
- Find the length of a tuple and access elements by index[^2].
- Use list comprehensions to flatten a nested list or filter positive numbers[^2].


### **Week 5: Queues \& Stacks (using built-in modules)**

- Create a queue, add several items, and remove them in FIFO order[^3].
- Check if a queue is empty and display its size[^3].
- Create a stack (LIFO queue), push and pop items, and display the stack[^3].

## **Tips for Practicing**

- Use a Jupyter notebook or any Python IDE to quickly test your solutions.
- After solving each problem, try to slightly modify it to reinforce your understanding (e.g., use different data types or larger datasets).
- Focus on writing clean, readable code with comments.
